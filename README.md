# Mystery Dining with Yelp - Project Documentation

## Introduction

This project utilizes the Yelp API to create a "mystery dining" experience for users.  They'll be presented with clues about a restaurant based on Yelp data, and then have to guess the restaurant's identity!

## Features:

Mystery Restaurant Selection: Uses the Yelp API to randomly select a restaurant based on user preferences (e.g., cuisine, price range).
Clue Generation: Generates clues based on various Yelp data points like restaurant name, address, cuisine type, rating, reviews, and photos.
Guessing Interface: Allows users to submit their guesses for the mystery restaurant.
Reveal: Shows the actual restaurant information and allows users to compare their guesses.
